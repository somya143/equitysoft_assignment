# equitysoft_assignment
This is an assignment I got from my interviewing company. Basically this a form management application where user can signup , 
login and create forms needed and view the form and can add questions to form and also add response to questions and submit.
I have used redux for state management, jwt-decode to decode the token after login. Using localstorage to store the token and refreshtoken.
I have used Chakra-Ui, an external CSS library for styling and axios to retrive the data from network request.
